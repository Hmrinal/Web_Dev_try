# Web_Dev_try

A trial based project for learning Web Programming. ToDo list is quite essential in both personal and professional life, so in order to test the skills it can be considered as the best option.

## Working

The project is a single webpage containing different list items and a text area to add custom tasks. The “Add” button lets the user add an object to the list. We have the facility to check the items from the list or remove them if we want. If we wish, we can clear all the list items with a single button. It is a very user-friendly and user-interactive project that makes the work of a user a lot easier.
